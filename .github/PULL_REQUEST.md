# Implement Database Migration CI/CD Pipeline

## What does this PR do?

This PR implements an automated CI/CD pipeline for database migrations, ensuring that schema changes are automatically applied to staging and production environments when code is pushed to the respective branches.

Key changes:
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for database migrations
- Created comprehensive documentation for the database package
- Set up branch-based environment targeting (staging/production)

## Why are these changes needed?

Previously, database migrations had to be run manually after deploying code changes, which:
1. Created a risk of schema/code version mismatches
2. Required manual intervention for every deployment
3. Increased the potential for human error during deployments

This automation ensures that database schema is always in sync with the codebase and reduces operational overhead.

## How was this tested?

The workflow was tested by:
1. Creating test schema changes in a development environment
2. Pushing to staging branch to verify the workflow execution
3. Confirming that schema changes were correctly applied to the staging database
4. Reviewing logs to ensure proper environment detection and command execution

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses GitHub Actions to:
- Detect changes to the database package
- Determine the target environment based on the branch (main → production, staging → staging)
- Set up the required Node.js and PNPM environment
- Run the appropriate database migration commands
- Use repository secrets for secure database connections

## Setup Requirements

For this workflow to function properly, the following GitHub repository secrets need to be configured:
- `DATABASE_URL` (or individual connection parameters)
- `DATABASE_USER`
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`
- `DATABASE_HOST`
- `DATABASE_PORT`
- `DATABASE_NAME`

These should be set up for both the staging and production environments in GitHub.
